        <p>
          In accordance with Art. 13 DSGVO we inform you about the legal basis
          of our data processing. If the legal basis is not stated in the data
          protection declaration, the following applies: The legal basis for
          obtaining consent is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a and Art. 7 DSGVO, the legal
          basis for processing for the purpose of fulfilling our services and
          implementing contractual measures and answering inquiries is Art. 6
          Para. 1 lit. b DSGVO, the legal basis for processing for the purpose
          of fulfilling our legal obligations is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c DSGVO,
          and the legal basis for processing for the purpose of safeguarding our
          legitimate interests is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. In the event that
          vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require
          the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d DSGVO serves as
          the legal basis.<br /><br />

        SECURITY MEASURES
      </h2>
      <div class="mb-3 text-sm">
        <p>
          In accordance with Art. 32 DSGVO and taking into account the state of
          the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances
          and purposes of the processing as well as the varying probability of
          occurrence and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of
          natural persons, we take appropriate technical and organizational
          measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
          <br /><br />
          These measures shall include, in particular, safeguarding the
          confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling the
          physical access to the data, as well as the access, input, disclosure,
          security of availability and separation of the data relating to them.
          Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure that the rights
          of data subjects are exercised, data is deleted, and we respond to any
          threats to the data. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal
          data into account as early as the development or selection of
          hardware, software and procedures, in accordance with the principle of
          data protection through technology design and through data
          protection-friendly presettings (Art. 25 DSGVO).<br /><br />

        COOPERATION WITH ORDER PROCESSORS AND THIRD PARTIES
      </h2>
      <div class="mb-3 text-sm">
        <p>
          If, in the course of our processing, we disclose data to other persons
          and companies (processors or third parties), transfer it to them or
          otherwise grant them access to the data, this is only done on the
          basis of a legal authorization (e.g. if a transfer of the data to
          third parties, such as payment service providers, is necessary for the
          performance of the contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b
          DSGVO), if you have consented, if a legal obligation provides for this
          or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents,
          web hosts, etc.).
          <br /><br />
          If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a
          so-called "contract processing agreement", this is done on the basis
          of Art. 28 DSGVO.<br /><br />

          If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union
          (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this is done in the
          context of using the services of third parties or disclosure or
          transfer of data to third parties, this will only take place if it is
          done to fulfil our (pre-)contractual obligations, on the basis of your
          consent, on the basis of a legal obligation or on the basis of our
          legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we
          will only process or transfer the data in a third country if the
          special requirements of Art. 44 ff. DSGVO. This means that the
          processing is carried out, for example, on the basis of special
          guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination of a level
          of data protection corresponding to that of the EU (e.g. for the USA
          through the "Privacy Shield") or compliance with officially recognized
          special contractual obligations (so-called "standard contractual

          primarily used to store information about a user (or the device on
          which the cookie is stored) during or after his visit to an online
          service. Temporary cookies, or "session cookies" or "transient
          cookies", are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online
          offer and closes his browser. In such a cookie, for example, the
          contents of a shopping cart in an online store or a login status can
          be stored. Cookies are described as "permanent" or "persistent" if
          they remain stored even after the browser is closed. For example, the
          login status can be saved if the user visits it after several days.
          Likewise, the interests of the users can be stored in such a cookie,
          which is used for range measurement or marketing purposes. Third-party
          cookies are cookies that are offered by providers other than the

        <p>
          We set within our online offer on the basis of our legitimate
          interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic
          operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1
          lit. f. DSGVO), we use content or service offers from third parties in
          order to integrate their content and services, such as videos or fonts
          (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content"). This always
          presupposes that the third-party providers of such content are aware
          of the IP address of the users, as without the IP address they would
          not be able to send the content to their browsers. The IP address is
          therefore necessary for the display of this content. We make every
          effort to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP
          address only to deliver the content. Third party providers may also
          use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web
          beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can
          be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages
          of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in
          cookies on the user's device and may contain technical information
          about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting
          times and other details about the use of our online offer, as well as
          being linked to such information from other sources.
